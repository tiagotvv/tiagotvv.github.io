For each hour sepsis treatment is delayed, the patient's risk of death increases by 4 percent (New England Journal of Medicine). It also helps reducing as hospital costs a patient as an ICU stay is much more costly to the hospital than a standard ward room. </div>                  <a href="./docs/Leveraging EHR data to predict patient outcomes.pdf" class="project-link">View presentation  (in portuguese)</a>

                    over multiple untrusted clouds or networks. Our main contribution is a low complexity scheme that relies on erasure coding techniques for achieving prescribed levels of confidentiality and reliability. Using matrices that have no singular square submatrices, we
                    subject the original data to a linear transformation. The resulting
                    coded symbols are then stored in different networks. This scheme
                    allows users with access to a threshold number of networks to reconstruct perfectly the original data, while ensuring that eavesdroppers with access to any number of networks smaller than this
                    threshold are unable to decode any of the original symbols. This
                    holds even if the attackers are able to guess some of the missing
                    symbols. We further quantify the achievable level of security, and

                      <div class="project-description">One of the stumbling blocks for implementation
                        of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks is the penetration rate: the
                        percentage of vehicles that have the communication equipment
                        installed. As the equipment deployment is unlikely to happen
                        instantaneously, it is important to explore the performance gains
                        achievable at low penetration rates. This especially pertains to
                        safety applications, which are expected to provide life-saving
                        information to all drivers on the road within a given region. We
                        propose a technique that can be employed by safety applications
                        to address the low penetration issue. By using visual cues on the
                        equipped vehicles, such as specific patterns of hazard warning
                        lights, we show that for all but the lowest vehicle densities, a
                        radio penetration rate of 30% is sufficient to inform more than
                        95% of drivers in the region of interest in a timely manner.</div>

                          <div class="project-description">A thorough understanding of the communications
                            channel between vehicles is essential for realistic modeling of
                            Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) and the development of
                            related technology and applications. The impact of vehicles as
                            obstacles on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication has been
                            largely neglected in VANET research, especially in simulations.
                            Useful models accounting for vehicles as obstacles must satisfy
                            a number of requirements, most notably accurate positioning,
                            realistic mobility patterns, realistic propagation characteristics,
                            and manageable complexity. We present a model that satisfies
                            all of these requirements. Vehicles are modeled as physical
                            obstacles affecting the V2V communication. The proposed model
                            accounts for vehicles as three-dimensional obstacles and takes
                            into account their impact on the LOS obstruction, received signal
                            power, and the packet reception rate.</div>
